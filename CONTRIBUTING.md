## About DOM (HTMX, Shoelace) and Session

Resources:

- https://docs.gofiber.io/next/ - Should be NEXT! We use v3 not v2!

Every element should use htmx and shoelace components (if any) to change the state.

If the state uses the user's data (for example, login button should become logout button),
the element should be generated by the server and should return a partial html (div/sl-button/..., thats why htmx).

Use the special Responder.IsHTMX() method to avoid separated api enpoints: use sigle url for htmx and json responses.

JavaScript should NOT be used, if possible. Possible reasons to add:
    - localStorage or cookies can not be manipulated or used by HTMX or changed by the server.
    - Shoelace components can not provide the specific functionality.

DOM manipulations should be provided through HTMX and the server. Cookies should be changed by the server, if possible.

If the server can change something while the client not available, the client should send a request.

### About JSON

Stop using it! We should use Query() and URI() intead of JSON() binds. Send all the data through query and url: `/login?name=user0?password=hash_skdlklsdf`

### About templates

Files in web/templates can be rendered through Go's template language:
https://pkg.go.dev/html/template

This means, you can use specific syntax and replacements, but the variables should be declared by the server, such as User.

User variable should be used to generate user-specific content: logout button, profile, viewable app page.
